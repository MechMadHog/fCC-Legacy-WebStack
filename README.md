# My freeCodeCamp Full Stack Path

This repository tracks my progress through the freeCodeCamp curriculum.

I started this to replace time spent scrolling with time spent building.
The goal is not speed. The goal is consistency.

I work on this every day.

---

## Status

Started: August 2025  
In Progress: **Quality Assurance** and **Information Security**  
These are the final two required for the **Full-Stack Certification**.

---

## Goal

Finish the full web certification path.  
Build real projects.  
Keep a public record.

Later, expand into Python and security as a separate track.

### Current

- [ ] Quality Assurance  
- [ ] Information Security  

These are slow and debugging-heavy. That is expected.

---

### Still To Do

- [ ] Relational Databases **(bonus)**  
  - Collection link to be added later.

---

## Bonus Material

These are treated as extensions of the main tracks.

- **Project Euler**  
  Math-heavy problems. Useful for Python and algorithms.

- **Rosetta Code**  
  Implementing the same ideas across different languages.

- **Coding Interview Prep**  
  Extra pattern recognition and problem solving.

---

## Supporting Tracks

- **The Odin Project**  
  A separate full web path. Used to reinforce fundamentals.
