# ⚙️ My freeCodeCamp Full Stack Path

This repository tracks my progress through the freeCodeCamp curriculum.

I started this to replace time spent scrolling with time spent building 🧠  
The goal is not speed. The goal is consistency.

I work on this every day.

## 📌 Status

Started: August 2025  
In Progress: **Quality Assurance** and **Information Security**  
These are the final two required for the **Full-Stack Certification**.

## 🎯 Goal

Finish the full web certification path.  
Build real projects.  
Keep a public record.

Later, expand into Python and security as a separate track 🔒
