# 🌐 My freeCodeCamp Full Stack Development Path

Tracking my full progress through the [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) curriculum - replacing social media with skill-building and working toward mastery in full-stack web development.

## 📅 Started: August 2025  
## 🔄 In Progress: **Quality Assurance** & **Information Security** - The last two required to gain the **Full-Stack Certification**

---

## 🎯 Goal
Complete the **first seven Web-focused certifications**, build portfolio-ready projects, and document everything to share the learning journey.  
Later on, expand into **Python + InfoSec** as a separate track.

## 📚 Bonus Material (These are treated as *sub-sections* to their relevant counterparts (JS, Python, or algorithms).  )

- **Project Euler** → Math-heavy problems (likely more relevant to the Python/InfoSec track).  
- **Rosetta Code** → Implementing algorithms & data structures in multiple languages.  
- **Coding Interview Prep** → Extra practice for problem-solving, pattern recognition, and technical interviews.

## 🛠 Ways to strengthen my JavaScript Skills:

- **The Odin Project** - Full web dev path; treated as its own track, complementing FCC.
